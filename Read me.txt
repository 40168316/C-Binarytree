This program was written and developed in Eclipse and compiled by Developer Command Prompt for VS2013.

To use the makefile, type in 'nmake all' into the command prompt and it will load the program.

For my program I decided to add a menu system so the user finds it easier to call functions. The user can call multiple functions is a single run which is exited by entering -1.
